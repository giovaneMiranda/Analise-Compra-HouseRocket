# 1. Business Problem. 

House Rocket is a digital platform whose bunisses model is the purchase and sale of real estate using technology.
House Rocket's CEO would lice to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities. 

The maind strategy is to buy good houses in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at highter prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue. 

- Which houses should the CEO of House Rocket buy and what purchase price?
- Once the house is owned by the company, what is the best time to sell them and what would be the sale price?

# 2. Business Assumptions.
The assumptions about the business problem is as follows:
- Seasonality impact real state demand. 
- Seasons: 
  - Winter starts on December
  - Spring starts on March
  - Summer starts on June
  - Fall starts on September

- Houses near lakes areas have higher prices.
- Criteria to determine wether a property is suitable for purchase. 
  - The proprerty must have condition greater or iqual than 3. 
  - The property price must be smaller than the median price on the region. 
- Criteria to determine a property sale. 
  - Property price greater than median region price per season, selling price is added in 30%
  - Property price less than median region price per season, selling price is added in 10%
  - Porperty will be sold in season with the highest profit. 
- Bathrooms will not be distinguished by their contents.
